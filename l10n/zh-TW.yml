# Regarding translations: My native language is English. Because this is a free
# and open-source hobby project which generates zero income, and translatable
# content is likely to change as the features and functionality supported by
# the project changes, it doesn't make sense for me to spend money for
# translations. Because I'm the sole author/developer/maintainer for the
# project and I'm not a ployglot, any translations I produce are very likely to
# contain errors. Sorry, but realistically, that won't ever change. If you find
# any such errors/typos/mistakes/etc, your assistance to correct them would be
# very much appreciated. Pull requests are invited and encouraged. Otherwise,
# if you find these errors too much to handle, just stick with the original
# English source. If a translation is irredeemably incomprehensible, let me
# know which, and I can delete it. If you're not sure how to perform pull
# requests, ask. I can help.
